# PyGoat CI/CD Practice

This repository is a personal DevOps practice project based on [PyGoat](https://github.com/0xpayne/PyGoat) ‚Äî a deliberately vulnerable Python/Flask web app used for security testing and awareness.

The goal of this project is to:
- Implement CI/CD pipelines from scratch
- Practice automated testing (unit, integration, security scans)
- Containerize and deploy the app
- Explore secrets management, branching strategies, and environment-based deployments
